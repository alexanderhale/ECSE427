NOTES ABOUT OPERATION OF ASSIGNMENT 1, PART 2

Executables
- output properly to redirected dump
- do not output properly to terminal
	- likely is executing in child process, not in parent terminal
		- have set up a pipe to try to get that output into the terminal, but it still isn't working
- does not output properly to redirect dump if there is no space before and after the '>'

cd
- works properly
	- prints the current location of the user in the filesystem
		- this isn't explicitly specified, but it's very helpful to the user

jobs
- outputs correctly

exit
- works properly

wc

background processes

Please note that all the TODOs in the code comments were left there as indicators of where I thought improvements might be made.
